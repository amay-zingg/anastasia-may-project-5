S.T.A.R. BABaaaY! (That song from The Guess Who lol)
Okay but seriously now...

Situation = specific

Task = why did you do it

Action = what did you do

Result = what is the outcome



Okay I'll try this for my latest experiment with the slideshow functionality

Situation = Add a slideshow of each of the art pieces in the tour

Task = Figure out how to properly use react-image-gallery and make it fit into my project!

Action = Add Footer to the App main page to make the slideshow it's own page
