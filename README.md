S.T.A.R. BABaaaY! (That song from The Guess Who lol)
Okay but seriously now...

Situation = specific

Task = why did you do it

Action = what did you do

Result = what is the outcome



Okay I'll try this for my latest experiment with the slideshow functionality

Situation = Add a slideshow of each of the art pieces in the tour

Task = Figure out how to properly use react-image-gallery and make it fit into my project! Making it fit on the page and scale through responsive sizing

Action = Made changes to file structure of SCSS so I could manipulate the slideshow library. Made the router functionality so that it opens in the "main" section of the site and not as a modal/popup.

Result = I think it looks pretty good now! The landing page functionality needs some work though...that show/hide dilemma
